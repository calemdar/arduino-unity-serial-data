# arduino-unity-serial-data
Transfer JSON data from an Arduino device to Unity

# HeartRateJSON
This is an example code from a Unity project I was working on. Recieving heart rate pulses using Arduino and a pulse sonsor, and getting this sensor information into Unity.
The Arduino outputs the data in JSON format: {"bpm":value,"amplitude":value}

# SerialJSON
This directory has template versions of the Arduino (.ino) and Unity (.cs) files to output JSON from Arduino, read the serial input in Unity, and put it inside a Unity object.
